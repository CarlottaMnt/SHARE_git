In this project we attempt to predict indicator of well being for people in their older ages.

The data come from SHARE and SHARELIFE. 

The well being indicators are: frailty index, mental index, life satisfaction, happiness, self perceived health. 

The folders are organize as follow:

 * Data: due to data privacy we upload only two main raw data.
 * Dataset_constructed: includes the dataframes for each module of sharelife
 * main_script: it includes the main script to use for replicate the results
 * MyData_file: includes the version of the module cleaned by unreliable observations
 * Output_file: empty folder to store the resutls
 * Panel: constructed panel dataset for the outcome variable plus the Job Episode Panel
 * Script: secondary scripts for dataframe constructions
