**WELL BEING IN OLD AGE PREDICTIONS**

In this project we attempt to predict indicator of well being for people in their olde ages.

Old age means individual that have more than 50 year old. 

The data come from SHARE and SHARELIFE. 

The well being indicators are: 
 1. Frailty index: measured as the proportion of deficit (out of 40) an individual stated to have suffered from.
 2. Mental index: measured as a bianary variable, 1 is depressed 0 is not depressed.
 3. Life satisfaction:  measured on a scale from 0 to 10. In general, how satisfied you are? 
 4. Happiness: how aften do you feel a sense of happiness? 
 5. Self perceived health. 

The folders are organized as follow:

 * **Data**: due to data privacy we upload only two main raw data.
 * **Dataset_constructed**: includes the dataframes for each module of sharelife
 * **main_script**: it includes the main script to use for replicate the results
 * **MyData_file**: includes the version of the module cleaned by unreliable observations
 * **Output_file**: empty folder to store the resutls
 * **Panel**: constructed panel dataset for the outcome variable plus the Job Episode Panel
 * **Script**: secondary scripts for dataframe constructions.
